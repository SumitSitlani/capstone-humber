#Capstone Humber Winter 2024

#Project Description:

This project involves the management of EOL data, as this is an industry-wide problem to manage multiple application and keeping track of their migration dates. This solution aims to provide a wholistic view into AWS applications running in the account and their information and trends by creating a dashboard on AWS managed Grafana and Tableau.

This repo consists of lambda functions which reads data and adds EOL data by calling an API.
